        the future plans here are largely predicated on whether folks find this
        useful. sure, there's some UI/UX shoring up to do. sure, there's some
        other creature comforts that all the other task managers have. but, if
        people don't really vibe with the general concepts (outlined in
        "background.txt"), then i'll just keep developing this to suit my own
        needs, and have the AGPL single-user version public at some point.

        if it's the sort of thing that people are vibing with, then i'll
        consider adding on some of those niceties (multi-user, user task
        assignments, more "enterprisey" shit) and doing a little SaaS version.
        i think that, irrespective of whether i do or not, i'll still have the
        AGPL version public but without the enterprise features. i think it's
        important that if people want to own their data then they should be
        able to do so.

        so, hey, keep me in the loop. if you're reading this, you're a friend,
        so you know how to get in touch.
