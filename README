        hello

        windswept is a project/task management system. at the moment it is very
        early in development and chiefly modelled after my own workflow and
        peculiarities. i strongly recommend reading ./docs/background.txt for
        some insight as to what said workflow and peculiarities entail.

        the data model has been purposely kept simple so that it can be
        customised andadapted for folks' individual workflows.

        i hope you will find windswept useful.


        you will need npm and cargo+rustc installed to run.

        build the frontend first:

            $ cd frontend
            $ npm install
            $ npm run build

        then, build the backend:

           $ cargo build

        to run:

           $ cargo run -- -h <host> -p <port> <path/to/json/storage/directory>

        create the json storage directory before running windswept. the backend
        will store `windswept.json` in this directory, which is used for
        storage and synchronisation.

        all changes to the tree are automatically saved to `windswept.json`
        and synchronised/broadcasted to all connected clients.


        in addition to `windswept.json`, a backup can be made at any time by
        pressing `ctrl-s`. a little message will appear, and a dated backup
        json file will be written to the json storage directory.

        since windswept is still in very early stages and data loss is still a
        strong possibility, you should take backups often.

        take care, and fly safe.
